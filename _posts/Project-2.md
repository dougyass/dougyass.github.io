<h2>Problem Statement and Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Will songs that improve less than 10 spots their 1st week on the top 100 peak faster?</p>

<h2>Risks and Assumptions</h2>
<p>The data analysis was performed based on a sample of 317 songs in the year 2000 that were on the Billboard top 100. We are assuming that these are the only 317 songs that were on the list and this is a full sample for the year 2000. After looking through the data, a couple of errors popped out. First, "Rock'n'Roll" and "Rock" were treated as two separate genres. Also "R&B" was sometimes listed as "R  &  B". Given these two minor errors, we can't be 100% confident that there aren't other similar errors in the dataset. </p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>After cleaning the data, I searched for any interesting trends. I saw that 'Rock' had the most Billboard Top 100 hits with 137 of the 317 songs followed by Country (74), Rap (58), R&B (23), Pop (9), Latin (9), Electronica (4), Gospel (1), Jazz (1), and Reggae (1). My primary focus was trying to see if any variables in the dataset could help predict how long it takes for a song to peak. Below is a visualization of "Average Days to Peak by Genre".
