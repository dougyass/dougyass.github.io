<h1>Predicting Top 250 IMDB Ratings</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Given IMDB Top 250 data, predict what features correspond with high ratings.</p>

<h2>Risks and Assumptions</h2>
<p> The main risk is that we are working with a limited data set. We are only looking at movies in the top 250 so with such a small sample size, it is difficult to draw accurate insights. On top of that, 2 of the top 3 predictors of ratings, budget and gross, had lots of missing values so our final sample size was down to 143 movies. Higher budgets and grosses led to higher IMDB ratings, but since we were just looking at the top 250 movies of all time the budgets and grosses were probably much higher than average. 

  </p>
<p>
The assumption was also made that we obviously couldn't just use IMDB rating as a metric for predicting IMDB ratings, but if Netflix wanted to know which movies to include in their top 250 reccomendations they could just use the IMDB rating.
</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>
After bringing in the initial data from IMDB, there weren't many factors that could predict the IMDB rating. Actors and directors have a big impact on the success of a movie but a single actor or director can't really set themselves apart against other movies that were also in the top 250. For example, a movie directed by Martin Scorcese starring Leonardo DiCaprio would be projected to get a high IMDB rating, but when compared to another top 250 movie the difference isn't as noticable.

	After bringing in the initial data set, I also added budget and gross to the data set. They proved to be the 2nd and 3rd most influential predictors of IMDB rating in top 250 movies. The most important feature by far was IMDB votes with a score of 0.62. This makes sense as total number of votes and actual rating are probably very highly correlated.  
</p>

<p>
	The final data set included IMDB votes, gross, budget, top 10 genres, top 10 actors, top 10 plot keywords (New York, Vietnam War, etc.), and total number of oscars won.

<p>
After dropping IMDB votes to see what feature importances would look like without it, we still see gross and budget as the two highest predictors. It's also interesting to note that the remaining features aren't similar to the first time we ran it. For example, Morgan Freeman's importance was below 0.009 the first time we ran it but was 0.57 the 2nd time we ran it. It is also worth noting that a high feature importance doesn't necessarily mean that it leads to a high IMDB rating, it just means it has a high impact on the IMDB rating but could be negatively impacting it. So while it's safe to assume that high IMDB votes correlates with high IMDB rating, we can't be sure that Brad Pitt (0.27207 feature importance) corresponds with higher or lower IMDB ratings when compared to other top 250 movies. For example, if he was in the 235th-250th best movies of all time, he would have a a high feature importance.

<p>
If we plot the relationships between the top 3 most important features we can see a trend between IMDB votes, but not much of a trend with gross or budget.

<h2> Conclusion</h2>

<p>
	There aren't many interesting factors that predict IMDB rating when only dealing with 143 movies, all of which are in the top 250. If we worked with a much bigger data set, and set our target variable to Top250/NotTop250 then we could derive some insights as to what factors lead to entering the top 250 on IMDB.
