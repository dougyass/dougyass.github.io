<h2>Non-Technical Audience</h2>
<p>The average salary for the 730 jobs we scraped from careerbuilder.com was $95,000. We grouped the salaries into two categories, low and high, based on whether the salary was over $95,000. We then ran several different tests to see how we could most accurately predict the salary. </p>

<p>
	First we ran a test to see which words in the job title are strong predictors of whether the salary will be high or low. We found that when the words level, coordinator, and analytics were in the job title the salary was likely lower than the $95,000 average. The words in the job title that were the strongest indicators of high salaries were infrastructure, architext, director, and engineering.
</p>
<p> We also were able to pull the description of each job from careerbuilder.com and test which words predict high or low salaries. The words in job description that were the strongest indicators of low salaries were 'analyst', 'position', 'job', 'support', 'opportunity', 'hire', 'new', 'systems', and 'time'. The words in job description that were the strongest indicators of high salaries were 'manager', 'responsible', 'experience', 'senior', 'business', and 'growing'.
	</p>

<p>
	In both the description of the job and the title of the job we found that if the word 'analyst' was mentioned the salary was likely under the $95,000 average. We also found that the word 'manager' whether it was in the job title or the description was a good indicator that the salary would be high.
</p>


<h2>Technical Audience</h2>
<p>
	Our model predicting salary based on job title had an accuracy of .66, a precision of .66, a recall of .57, and a roc_auc of .75. We ran 'CountVectorizer' on the job titles and capped the total words at 50. 
</p>
<p>
	When looking at words in job title, 'level' had a coefficient of -4.4 which was the lowest of any word. 'Coordinator' had a coefficent of -3.0, and 'analytics' had a coefficient of -1.14. As for predicting high salaries, 'infrastructure' had a coefficient of 4.2, architect was 2.86, director was 2.3, and engineering was 1.9.
</p>

<p>
	For job descriptions, 'analyst' had a coefficient of -1, position was -.45, and job was -.30. We didn't see as strong predictors of high salaries for descriptions as we did with job titles. The highest coefficient was manager with .79, followed by 'responsible .63, and experience .63.
</p>
<p> We also created a patsy matrix based on city, state, company, title, and description. Our target was the 'label' column which had '0' or '1' based on if the salary was above or below average. We used a test size of 1/3 and our model had a precision of .68, a recall of .67, and an f-score of .68, which were very similar to the numbers we had when predicting using count vectorization with job title. We also ran an L1 model which had the same results when we used C of 500.
