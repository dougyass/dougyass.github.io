<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Given airport delay data, conduct a PCA to discover the prinicpal components behind airport departure delays.</p>

<h2>Risks and Assumptions</h2>
<p>There aren't many risks and assumptions with this dataset. As always there is the risk that the data is innacurate, but other than that this was a pretty standard dataset.  </p>


<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>
The data didn't hold many surprises. Major airports like JFK and LaGuardia had the most delays.

</p>

<p>

	First I looked at a pairplot and a heatmap of the data to see if there were any correlations in the dataset.

<p>
	Next, I conducted a PCA on the dataset targeting 2 principal components. I plotted the results on a scatterplot with PC1 as the x-axis and PC2 as the y-axis. </p>

<p>
	This gives us a sense of how clustered the data is but it doesn't show which points are assigned to with FAA regions.
</p>

<p> Next I ran a K-Means test to cluster the data into the 8 different FAA Regions as seen below.

<h2> Conclusion</h2>

<p>
	We can now see the separations of FAA regions based on our PCA.
